A collection of SQL style tips developed over the years

### Lowercase vs Uppercase

Uppercase vs Lowercase can be a contentious topic, capitalisation is best for production code for ease of reading. For everything else lowercase is fine as most modern coding tools have highlighting to save yourself toggling caps lock. The main thing is consistency.  

:thumbsup:
```sql
select * from orders
```
:thumbsdown:
```sql
Select * FROM orders

```

### Single vs Multi line queries


Single line queries should be used sparingly, the only real use case is when you are writing a very simple query like:

:thumbsup:
```sql
select * from orders limit 10

select count(*) from orders

```


as we add more complexity using multiple lines to makes it easier to read:

:thumbsup:
```sql
select
    id
    ,created_at
    ,customer_name
    ,amount
from orders

select *
from users
where email = 'example@domain.com'

select
    user_id
    ,count(*) as total_charges
from charges
group by user_id
```

:thumbsdown:
```sql
select id, email, created_at
from users

select id
    ,email
from users
```

### Left alignment

Keeping all the keywords on the left makes identifying the key bits of the query easier:

:thumbsup:
```sql
select
    id
    ,created_at
    ,customer_name
    ,amount
from users
where id = 1
```

### where should those pesky commas go?

Having the commas at the start of the lines I think makes it more readable, easier to spot missing comas and easier to comment out columns for tweaking queries.

```sql
-- general
select
    id
    ,email
from users
```

### Single quotes '' vs ""

Some tools reserve double quotes for column name parsing but all tools accept single quotes so its safer to stick with them:

:thumbsup:
```sql
select
  *
from orders
where customer_name = 'Bob'
```

:thumbsdown:
```sql
select
  *
from orders
where customer_name = "Bob"
```

### Use `<>` or `!=`

A lot of people use `<>` but for me `!=` is clearer, it relates nicely with equals but with a not(!) in front of it:

:thumbsup:
```sql
select
  *
from orders
where customer_name != 'Bob'
```
